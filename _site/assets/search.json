    "content": "Hi! I am a postdoc in the lab of Austin Roorda at UC Berkeley in the School of Optometry.\n\nI received my PhD from the Graduate Program in Neuroscience at University of Washington in Seattle WA. My disseration research was conducted in the labs of Jay and Maureen Neitz.\n\nResearch interests\n\nI am interested in understanding the neural basis of sensory experience. Primary sensory neurons, such as cone photoreceptors, gather real-time information about the environment for the purpose of  influencing the organism’s behavior. The samples are relayed to downstream centers in the form of discrete action potentials. Those signals, however, are often noisy and unreliable, as many perceptual illusions demonstrate.  To minimize ambiguity, the brain leverages at least three sources of information during perceptual processing: 1) feed-forward signals from sensory neurons, 2) prior experience and 3) feedback signals. The purpose of my work is to understand how incoming sensory input is incorporated with other sources of sensory information to produce a coherent interpretation.\n\nCurrent projects\n\nMy postdoctoral research investigates the neural mechanisms underlying elementary visual processing with a technique called adaptive optics. Adaptive optics is a tool for measuring structure and function of the retina at a cellular scale in human subjects. I use adaptive optics to simultaneously image and stimulate identified cone photoreceptors in human subjects and record their perceptual experience.  A stimulus that falls on only a single cone is under-sampled from the perspective of color vision – the brain is missing information from the other two classes of cones. For this reason, the brain is forced to rely on prior experience when judging the color of each tiny spot. The motivation of this work is to understand how the visual system creates a meaningful sensory experience of the external world from the signals that are encoded by the cone mosaic. In our initial experiments, we mapped, for the first time, the spatial topography of color percepts at the level of the cone mosaic. Across trials, a single cone tended to yield a consistent color sensation. The greatest predictor of the color reported was the cone-type probed. This observation suggested that the visual system possesses prior information with sufficient resolution to remember the spectral identity of each cone. Together, this work has implications for our understanding of the basic mechanisms sub-serving color vision and could potentially be leveraged when optimizing retinal prosthetics.\n\n\nFigure 1. Adaptive optics image of my right eye taken at three different retinal locations. A. Very center of the retina or foveola. Cones here are very small (each blob is a single cone). This is where what we use to read fine print. B. 1.5 degrees away from the center of gaze. At this location cones become larger in size and rods (the smaller blobs) are found in about equal number to the cones C. 5 degrees away from center. Here rods become clearly visible and more numerous than cones. Scale bar = 1 arcmin or about 5 microns. For reference, the width of a human hair is about 30-100 microns.\n\nPublications\n\nSelected:\n\nSensations from a single M-cone depend on the activity of surrounding S-cones.
