 # Unraveling sight at a cellular scale
 ## Brian P. Schmidt, PhD

#### Source code

* [AOVIS_projector][projector]. A simple program for displaying an external fixation spot, background and eccentricity grid using an external projector. Developed while a postdoc in the Roorda Lab.

* [AOVIS_toolbox][toolbox]. A collection of useful MATLAB scripts for processing and analyzing AO vision studies. Some of these files were developed by prior members of the Roorda Lab.

* [AOMcontrol][aomcontrol]. MATLAB interface developed by the lab of Austin Roorda for delivering stimuli in an Adaptive Optica Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscope.

* [LM-ratio][lmratio]. A stand-alone python program for computing L:M cone ratio from flicker photometric data collected with [electroretinograms][ERGs]. Developed in the Neitz lab following published [protocols](https://jov.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2121455).


#### Published research

* [Source code and data][NeitzModel] for Schmidt, Neitz, Neitz (2014). Journal of the Optical Society of America A.  A model of human color perception.

**Notes:**

*1. L cone sensitivities were based on the sequence of each subjects L pigment.*

*2. Amino acids reported: exon 2—65, 111, 116; exon 3—153, 171, 174, 180; and exon 4—230, 233, 236.*

*3. For females with two L sequences, the peak sensitivity of both pigments was averaged to compute the reported peak L cone sensitivity.*

*4. All subjects had M cone peak values of 530 nm. All subjects identified as Caucasian except subjects U12 and U13, who were of Asian ethnicity.*

Data were published in the appendix of Schmidt, Touch, Neitz, Neitz (2016). "Circuitry to explain how the relative number of L and M cones shapes color experience." They published here for easier access.
