#Neitz model

### Motivation
***
* Not actually going to be talking much about Luv space.
* Has interesting property that distance within space is roughly uniform in terms of color discrimination.
* However, not currently correct, for reasons that we will see.
* Only a least squares approximation.

#### Color spaces
1. Go through the demonstration.
2. Why should we care:
	* How do we represent a spectrum of light in terms of perception.
	* Of major importance for many industries. Obviously visual work such as graphics, but also every carpet, paint, desk, tile. Everything has color! Need a system to specify what we mean.
	* We rely on this all the time in this lab, but don't necessarily think about it in formal terms.
	* Examples: Unique hues, 100 hue, anomaloscope, etc.
	* Can formally represent this in matrix notation. System A, brings us from Spectral Sensitivities to color matching functions.
	* Individual variability in color perception.
	* Most people think of color spaces in terms of representing color, with an antagonistic (or misinformed) view of the circuitry that actually processes color. We want to use color spaces to infer some principles about the underlying physiology.

#### Neitz space

A series of linear transformations. Spare everyone the gory details ... for now!

1. Move from cones to 'fundamentals'
2. Fundamentals to color matching data:
	* Normalized to equal energy white
	* Negative lights - for now.
3. Normalize
4. Plot only x and y since Z = 1 - x - y

Discuss briefly unique hues. How things should plot out.

### Color perception
***
#### Confusion lines

If this isn't making much sense, lets think a little about color deficiencies, which are more familiar to all of us.

**Tritan** S-cone silencing. Directions along these paths will produce no change in the LM cones.

**Deutan** M-cone silencing. Directions along these paths will produce no change in the LS cones.

**Protan** L-cone silencing. Directions along these paths will produce no change in the MS cones.

Can we read cone ratios from this plot in a color normal individual?

#### L:M ratio

* Let's start by looking at the lines we just heard about. The tritan and deutan confusion lines. These are also called the spectral neutral points since they go through equal energy. 

* In a color normal individual, we posit that these spectral neutral points will be determined by the L:M cone ratio. 


#### Unique hues, failure of the 'Standard model'

* Here we see results from two individuals identifying unique green.
* A large variance in unique green has been observed, but a parsimonious account of this variability has never been proposed

### Building a color model
***
#### Neitz model
* Standard model - 90-95% of cones involved in red green perception and only 5-10% involved in blue yellow


(S+M+L) - L and (S+M+L) - M 

#### First Stage

* Lens and macula filters, source of variability 
* Cone spectral sensitivity functions
* Correct for optical filters.

#### Second Stage

* Opponent mechanisms

#### Third Stage

* Summation

### Findings
***

#### Unique hues

* Very close agreement

#### Periphery
