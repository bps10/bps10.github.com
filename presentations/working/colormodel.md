#Neitz model

## Introduction
***

#### Color spaces
* How do we represent a spectrum of light in terms of perception.
* We do this all the time in this lab, but don't necessarily think about it in formal terms.
* Examples: Unique hues, 100 hue, anomaloscope, etc.
* Can formally represent this in matrix notation. System A, brings us from Spectral Sensitivities to color matching functions.
	* Color spaces. Why bother?
	* Cone sensitivities now known.
	* Predict color matching data.
	* Fully specify colors.
* Individual variability in color perception.

#### Neitz space


A series of linear transformations. Spare everyone the gory details ... for now!

1. Move from cones to 'fundamentals'
2. Fundamentals to color matching data:
	* Normalized to equal energy white
	* Negative lights - for now.
3. Normalize
4. Plot

Discuss briefly unique hues. How things should plot out.

#### Confusion lines

If this isn't making much sense, lets think a little about color deficiencies, which are more familiar to all of us.

**Tritan** S-cone silencing. Directions along these paths will produce no change in the LM cones.

**Deutan** M-cone silencing.

**Protan** L-cone silencing.

Can we read cone ratios from this plot?

#### CIE, unique hues and L:M ratio

#### Unique hues, failure of the 'Standard model'

#### Neitz model

(S+M+L) - L and (S+M+L) - M
