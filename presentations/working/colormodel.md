#Neitz model

## Introduction
***

#### Neitz space
* Color spaces. Why bother?
* Cone sensitivities now known.
* Predict color matching data.
* Fully specify colors.

A series of linear transformations. Spare everyone the gory details ... for now!

1. Move from cones to 'fundamentals'
2. Fundamentals to color matching data:
	* Normalized to equal energy white
	* Negative lights - for now.
3. Normalize
4. Plot

Discuss briefly unique hues. How things should plot out.

#### Confusion lines

If this isn't making much sense, lets think a little about color deficiencies, which are more familiar to all of us.

**Tritan** S-cone silencing. Directions along these paths will produce no change in the LM cones.

**Deutan** M-cone silencing.

**Protan** L-cone silencing.

Can we read cone ratios from this plot?

#### CIE, unique hues and L:M ratio

#### Unique hues, failure of the 'Standard model'

#### Neitz model: (S+M+L) - L
